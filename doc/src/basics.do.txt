===== Getting access to Python =====
label{basics:accesspy}


Simple mathematical calculations can be done in plain Python, but for
more advanced scientific computing, as we do here, several add-on
packages are needed. Getting all software correctly installed used to
be quite challenging, but today there are several easy-to-use approaches
to get access to Python.

=== Mac and Windows ===

We recommend to download and install
"Anaconda": "https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/",
which is a free distribution of Python that
comes with most of the packages you need for
advanced scientific computing.

=== Ubuntu ===

Debian-based Linux systems, such as Ubuntu, can also use Anaconda,
but it is more common to use the `apt-get` command-line tool or the
Ubuntu installer to install a set of Debian packages. Here is a
list of the packages you need to install for this introduction:

!bc sys
Terminal> sudo apt-get install python-pip python-setuptools \
  python-scipy python-sympy python-cython python-matplotlib \
  python-dev python-profiler pydb spyder imagemagick gedit vim \
  emacs python-mode git mercurial lib-avtools gnome-terminal
!ec
In addition, run

!bc sys
Terminal> pip install nose
Terminal> pip install pytest
Terminal> pip install ipython --upgrade
Terminal> pip install tornado --upgrade
Terminal> pip install pyzmq --upgrade
!ec

=== Web access ===

You can also access Python directly through a web browser without having
it installed on your local computer. We refer to the document
"How to access Python for doing scientific computing": "http://hplgit.github.io/edu/accesspy/accesspy.html" for more details on such tools and also
installations based on Anaconda and Ubuntu.

===== Mathematical example =====

We shall use a famous mathematical formula in our
forthcoming programming examples.
The formula tells how long distance $s$ an object has moved in
a time interval $[0,t]$ if it starts
out with a velocity $v_0$ and undergoes constant acceleration $a$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
s = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2\thinspace .
label{basics:seq}
\end{equation}
!et
We may view $s$ as a function of $t$: $s(t)$, and also include the
parameters in the notation: $s(t;v_0,a)$.

===== A program for evaluating a formula =====
label{basics:formula:eval}

idx{text editor}
idx{program file}

Here is a Python program for computing $s$, given $t=0.5$, $v_0=2$,
and $a=0.2$:

@@@CODE src-bumpy/distance.py
% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
The program is pure text and must be placed in a *pure text file* using
a *text editor*. Popular text editors are
Gedit, Nano, Emacs, and Vim on Linux,
TextWrangler on Mac OS X, and Notepad++ on Windows.
Save the text to a
program file whose name ends in `.py`, say `distance.py`.

The program is run in a terminal window (Command Prompt on Windows,
Terminal application on Mac OS X, `xterm` or `gnome-terminal` on Linux):

!bc sys
Terminal> python distance.py
1.025
!ec
The result of the `print` statement is the number `1.025` in the terminal
window.

As an alternative to writing programs in a text editor and executing them
in a terminal window, you may
use the "Spyder": "https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/"
graphical interface which gives a more Matlab-style
environment to work in. Anaconda installations come with Spyder.

idx{assignment statement}
idx{print statement}
idx{variable}
% endif



The code snippet above first contains four *assignment statements* where we
assign numbers or the results of arithmetic expressions to *variables*.
The variables have names coinciding with the mathematical notation
used in the formula: `t`, `v0`, `a`, and `s`. You may think of
variables in this programs just as variables in mathematics.

idx{objects}
idx{`float`}
idx{`int`}

!bnotice More technical details
A statement like `t = 0.5` works as follows. First, the right-hand side
is interpreted by Python as a real number and a `float` object containing
the value 0.5 is created. Then the name `t` is defined as a reference
to this object.

In the statement `s = v0*t + 0.5*a*t**2`, Python will first go to the
right-hand side and observe that it is an arithmetic expression
involving variables with known values (or names referring to existing
objects). The arithmetic expression is calculated, resulting in a
real number that is saved as a `float` object with value 1.025 in
the computer's memory.

Everything in Python is an object of some type. Here, `t`, `a`, and `s`
are `float` objects, representing real (floating-point) numbers, while
`v0` is an `int` object, representing the integer 2.
There are many other types of objects: strings, lists, tuples,
dictionaries, arrays, files, ...
!enotice

===== Formatted output with text and numbers =====
label{basics:printf}

idx{formatting of numbers}
idx{printf syntax}

For any object `s` in Python, `print s` will (normally) print the contents
of `s`. However, sometimes we want to combine the content of an object
with some text. Say we want to print `s=1.025` rather than just the number.
This is easily accomplished using *printf* syntax:

!bc pycod
print 's=%g' % s
!ec
The output is specified as a string, enclosed in single or double quotes.
Inside the string, there can be ``slots'' for numbers (or other
objects), indicated by a percentage sign followed by a specification of
kind of data that will be inserted at this place. In the string above,
there is one such slot, `%g`, where the `g` implies a real number written
as compactly as possible.

It is easy to control the number of decimals using printf syntax.
Printing out `s=1.03`, i.e., `s` with two decimals, is done by

!bc pycod
print 's=%.2f' % s
!ec
where the `f` signifies a *decimal number* and the preceding `.2` means
2 decimals. Scientific notation, as in `s=1.03E+00` ($1.03\cdot 10^0$),
is specified as `%.2E` (2 decimals).

idx{format string syntax}

The printf syntax is available in numerous programming languages.
Python also offers a related variant, called *format string syntax*:

!bc pycod
print 's={s:.2f}'.format(s=s)
!ec

===== While loops =====
label{basics:while}

idx{while loop}

Suppose we want to make a table with two columns, one with $t$ values and
one with the corresponding $s$ values. Now we have to repeat a lot
of calculations with the formula (ref{basics:seq}). This is easily
done with a *loop*. There are two types of loops in Python: *while* loops
and *for* loops.

Let the $t$ values go from 0 to 2 in increments of 0.1. The following
program applies a *while* loop:

@@@CODE src-bumpy/while.py

% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
The result of running this program in a terminal window
is

!bc sys
Terminal> python while.py
0 0.0
0.1 0.201
0.2 0.404
0.3 0.609
0.4 0.816
0.5 1.025
0.6 1.236
0.7 1.449
0.8 1.664
0.9 1.881
1.0 2.1
1.1 2.321
1.2 2.544
1.3 2.769
1.4 2.996
1.5 3.225
1.6 3.456
1.7 3.689
1.8 3.924
1.9 4.161
!ec
% endif

idx{boolean expression}
idx{`True`}
idx{`False`}

So, how do we interpret the contents of this program? First we initialize four
variables: `v0`, `a`, `dt`, and `t`. Everything after `#` on
a line is a *comment* and does not affect what happens in the program, but
is meant to be of help for a human reading the program.
Then comes the while loop:

!bc pycod
while condition:
    <intented statement>
    <intented statement>
    <intented statement>
!ec
Observe the colon at the end of the `while` line.
The set of indented statements are repeated as long as the expression or
variable `condition` evaluates to `True`. In the present case, the condition
is the *boolean expression* `t <= 2`, so as long as the value is less
than or equal to 2,
`t <= 2` evaluates to `True`, otherwise it evaluates to `False`.

!bwarning Error in the code
According to the code, the last pass in the while loop should correspond
to $t=2$, but looking at the output, we see that the last print
statement has $t=1.9$. The next test in the while condition involves
$t=2$ and the boolean condition is expected to be `2 == 2`. However,
it seems that the condition is `False` since the computations for
$t=2$ are not printed. Why do we experience this behavior?
!ewarning

idx{Python Online Tutor}

The "Python Online Tutor": "http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit"
is a great tool to examine the program flow. Consider this little loop
run in the Python Online
% if FORMAT == 'html':
Tutor (view in Chrome):
% else:
Tutor:
% endif

!bc pyoptpro
a = 0
da = 0.4
while a <= 1.2:
    print a
    a = a + da
!ec
The Python Online Tutor executes each statement and displays the contents
of variables such that you can track the program flow and the evolution
of variables.

So, why is not `a` printed for 1.2? That is, why does `a == 1.2` evaluate to
`True` when `a` is (expected to be) 2? We must look at the accuracy of
`a` to investigate this question and write it out with 16 decimals in
scientific notation (printf specification `%.16E`):

!bc pyoptpro
a = 0
da = 0.4
while a <= 1.2:
    print a
    a = a + da
    # Inspect all decimals in da and a
    print 'da=%.16E\na=%.16E' % (da, a)
    print 'a <= 1.2: %g' %  (a <= 1.2)
!ec
% if FORMAT in ('latex', 'pdflatex'):
The output becomes

!bc
0
4.0000000000000002E-01, 4.0000000000000002E-01 True
0.4
4.0000000000000002E-01, 8.0000000000000004E-01 True
0.8
4.0000000000000002E-01, 1.2000000000000002E+00 False
!ec
% endif
The problem is that `da` is not exactly 0.4, but contains a small round-off
error. Doing `a = a + da` then results in a slightly inaccurate `a`.
When the exact `a` should reach 1.2, the `a` in the program has a
an error and equals `1.2000000000000002`. Obviously the test for
exact equality, `a == 1.2`, becomes `False`, and the loop is terminated.

!bwarning Rule: use exact equality `==` when comparing real numbers
Always compare real numbers using the difference and a tolerance:

!bc pycod
a = 1.2
b = 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.4
boolean_condition1 = a == b              # False
tol = 1E-14
boolean_condition2 = abs(a - b) < tol    # True
!ec
!ewarning

The Python Online Tutor is ideal for demonstrating program flow and
contents of variables in small and simple programs. However, you should
use a real debugger instead when searching for errors in real programs.

===== Lists =====
label{basics:list}

idx{list}

The table created in the previous section has two columns of data.
We could store all the numbers in each column in a *list* object.
A list is just a collection of objects, here numbers, in a given
sequence. For example,

!bc pycod
L = [-1, 1, 8.0]
!ec
is a list of three numbers. Lists are enclosed in square brackets
and may contain any type of objects separated by commas. Here
we mix a filename (string), a real number, and an integer:

!bc pycod
L = ['mydata.txt', 3.14, 10]
!ec

The different list *elements* can be reached via indexing: `L[0]` is
the first element, `L[1]` is the second, and `L[-1]` is the last element.
Here is an *interactive Python shell* where we can write Python statements
and examine the contents of variables as we perform various operations:

!bc pyshell
>>> L = ['mydata.txt', 3.14, 10]
>>> print L[0]
mydata.txt
>>> print L[1]
3.14
>>> del L[0]  # delete the first element
>>> print L
[3.14, 10]
>>> print len(L)  # length of L
2
>>> L.append(-1)  # add -1 at the end of the list
>>> print L
[3.14, 10, -1]
!ec

Let us store the numbers in the previous table in lists, one for each
column. We can start with empty lists `[]` and use `append` to
add a new element to the lists in each pass of the while loop. Thereafter,
we can run a new while loop and print the contents of the lists in a
nice, tabular fashion:

@@@CODE src-bumpy/while_list.py

% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
The output looks like

!bc
[0.0, 0.201, 0.404, 0.6090000000000001, 0.8160000000000001,
 1.025, 1.236, 1.4489999999999998, 1.664, 1.8809999999999998,
 2.0999999999999996, 2.3209999999999997, ...]
0.00  0.0000
0.10  0.2010
0.20  0.4040
0.30  0.6090
0.40  0.8160
0.50  1.0250
0.60  1.2360
0.70  1.4490
...
!ec
% endif

Note that `print s_values` here leads to output with many
decimals and small round-off errors. To get complete control of the
formatting of real numbers in the table, we use the printf
syntax.

Lists come with a lot of functionality. See the
"Python Tutorial": "https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#lists"
for many more examples.

===== For loops =====
label{basics:for}

idx{for loop}

A for loop is used for visiting elements in a list, one by one:

!bc pyshell
>>> L = [1, 4, 8, 9]
>>> for e in L:
...     print e
...
1
4
8
9
!ec
The variable `e` is successively set equal to the elements in the list,
in the right order. Note the colon at the end of the `for` line.
The statements to be executed in each pass of the loop (here only
`print e`) must be indented. When `e` is set equal to the last element and
all indented statements are executed, the loop is over, and the program
flow continues with the next statement that is not indented.
Try the following code out in the Python Online Tutor:

!bc pyoptpro
list1 = [0, 0.1, 0.2]
list2 = []
for element in list1:
    p = element + 2
    list2.append(p)
print list2
!ec

A for loop over the valid indices in a list is created by

!bc pycod
for i in range(len(somelist)):
    # Work with somelist[i]
!ec
The `range` function returns a list of integers: `range(a, b, s)`
returns the integers `a, a+s, a+2*s, ...` up to *but not including* `b`.
Just writing `range(b)` implies `a=0` and `s=1`, so
`range(len(somelist))` returns `[0, 1, 2]`.

idx{list comprehension}

!bwarning For loops over real numbers
The `for i in range(...)` construction can only run a loop over integers.
If you need a loop over real values, you have to either create a list
with the values first, or use a formula where each value is generated
through an integer counter:

!bc pycod
# Need loop over 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1
values = []
for i in range(11):
    values.append(i*0.1)

# Shorter version using list comprehension (same as the loop above)
values = [i*0.1 for i in range(11)]

for value in values:
    # work with value
!ec
!ewarning

We can now rewrite our program that used lists and while loops to use
for loops instead:

@@@CODE src-bumpy/for_list.py
Observe that we have here used a slightly different technique
for computing the $t$
values inside the first loop: now we set $t$ as $i\Delta t$, where
$\Delta t$ (`dt` in the code) is the increment (0.1) between each
$t$ value. The computation of `n`, the number of $t$ values,
makes use of `round` to make a correct mathematical rounding to the nearest
integer (and `int` makes an integer object out of the rounded real number).
(In an interval $[a,b]$ divided into subintervals of equal length $\Delta t$,
there will be $1 + (b-a)/\Delta t$ points in total.)

idx{`zip`}
idx{multiple lists traversal with `zip`}

Running through multiple lists simultaneously is done with the `zip`
construction:

!bc pycod
for e1, e2, e3, ... in zip(list1, list2, list3, ...):
!ec
One may instead create a for loop over all the legal index values
instead and index each array,

!bc pycod
for i in range(len(list1)):
    e1 = list1[i]
    e2 = list2[i]
    ...
!ec


===== Arrays =====
label{basics:numpy}

idx{array}
idx{`numpy`}

Lists are useful for collecting a set of numbers or other objects
in a single variable. Arrays are much like lists, but tailored for collection
of numbers. The primary advantage of arrays is that you can use
them very efficiently and conveniently in mathematical computations,
but the downside is that an array has (in practice) a fixed length and
all elements must be of the same type. This is usually no important
restriction in scientific computations.

Much of Python's functionality are coded in *modules*. To use such
functionality, one must *import* the relevant modules. Arrays, for
example, are available in the `numpy` module, which must be imported.
Functions or variables in the module must be prefixed by `numpy`.
This will be demonstrated below.
Here is an example involving basic operations with arrays:

!bc pyshell
>>> L = [1, 4, 10.0]    # List of numbers
>>> import numpy
>>> a = numpy.array(L)  # Make corresponding array
>>> print a
[  1.   4.  10.]
>>> print a[1]
4.0
>>> print a.dtype       # Data type of an element
float64
>>> b = 2*a + 1
>>> print b
[  3.   9.  21.]
!ec
Note that all elements in the `a` array are of `float` type
(because one element in `L` was `float`).
Arithmetic expressions such as `2*a+1` work with `a` as array, but not
as list. In fact, we can pass arrays to mathematical functions:

!bc pyshell
>>> c = numpy.log(a)
>>> print c
[ 0.          1.38629436  2.30258509]
!ec

idx{`linspace`}

The `numpy` module has a lot of very useful utilities. To create
$n+1$ uniformly distributed
coordinates in an interval $[a,b]$, stored in an array, one
can use `linspace`:

!bc pycod
t = numpy.linspace(a, b, n+1)
!ec
This construction makes it easy to create arrays for the $t$ and $s$
values in our tables:

@@@CODE src-bumpy/for_array.py


===== Mathematical functions =====
label{basics:math}

idx{mathematical functions}
idx{`math`}

Python offers access to all standard mathematical functions such as
$\sin x$, $\cos x$, $\tan x$, $\sinh x$, $\cosh x$, $\tanh x$,
all their inverses (called `asin(x)`, `asinh(x)`, and so forth), $e^x$
(`exp(x)`), $\ln x$ (`log(x)`), and $x!$ (`factorial(x)`).
However, one has to import a module to get access to these functions.
For scalars (single numbers) the relevant module is `math`:

!bc pyshell
>>> import math
>>> print math.sin(math.pi)
1.2246467991473532e-16
!ec
which shows that the sine function is only approximate (to 16 digits).
Many prefer to write mathematical expressions without the `math` prefix:

!bc pycod
from math import sin, pi
print sin(pi)

# Or import everything from math
from math import *
print sin(pi), log(e), tanh(0.5)
!ec

The `numpy` module contains sine, cosine, and other mathematical functions
that work on scalars as well as arrays.

idx{import of modules}

!bnotice Import of `numpy`
To get Python code that is as similar to Matlab as possible, one would
do a ``start import'' of everything,

!bc pycod
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 1, 101)
y = exp(-x)*sin(pi*x)
!ec
However, in the Python community it has been a culture to use
a prefix `np` as abbreviation for `numpy`:

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)
y = np.exp(-x)*np.sin(np.pi*x)
!ec

Our convention is to use the `np` prefix for typical Matlab functions,
but skip the prefix when working with mathematical functions like
`exp(x)*sin(pi*x)`to get a one-to-one correspondence between formulas
in the program and in the mathematical description of the problem.

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
from numpy import sin, exp, pi
x = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)
y = exp(-x)*sin(pi*x)
!ec
!enotice

===== Plotting =====
label{basics:plot}

idx{plotting}
idx{graphics}
idx{visualization}
idx{`matplotlib`}

We can easily make a graph of a function $s(t)$ using the module
`matplotlib`. The technique is to compute an array of $t$ values
and a corresponding array of function values $s(t)$. Plotting
programs will draw straight lines between the points on the curve,
so a sufficient number of points are needed to give the impression
of a smooth curve. Our $s(t)$ function is plotted by the following
code:

@@@CODE src-bumpy/plot1.py
% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
The plotfile `myplot.png` looks like

FIGURE: [fig-bumpy/plot1_s, width=500 frac=0.7]
% endif

Matlab users may prefer to do

!bc pycod
from numpy import *
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
!ec
such that they can use `linspace` and `plot` without any prefix, just as
in Matlab.

Two curves can easily be plotted, this time also with labels on the
axis and a box with legends such that we can distinguish the two curves:

@@@CODE src-bumpy/plot1.py

% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
FIGURE: [fig-bumpy/plot2_s, width=500 frac=0.7]
% endif

!split
======= Functions and branching =======
label{basics:func:branching}

===== Functions =====
label{basics:func}

idx{function (in Python)}

Since $s(t)$ is a function in mathematics, it is convenient to have
it as a function in Python too:

!bc pypro
def s(t):
    return v0*t + 0.5*a*t**2

v0 = 0.2
a = 4
value = s(3)   # Call the function
!ec

Note that

 * functions start with the keyword `def`
 * statements belonging to the function must be indented
 * function input is represented by arguments
   (separated by comma if more than one)
 * function output is returned to the calling code

idx{global variables}

In this program, `v0` and `a` are *global variables*, which must be
defined before calling the `s(t)` function, otherwise `v0` and `a`
becomes undefined variables in the expression inside the function.

Instead of having `v0` and `a` as global variables, we may let them be
function arguments:

!bc pypro
def s(t, v0, a):
    return v0*t + 0.5*a*t**2

value = s(3, 0.2, 4)   # Call the function

# More readable call
value = s(t=3, v0=0.2, a=4)
!ec

idx{keyword arguments}
idx{default arguments}

Function arguments may also be declared to have a default value,
allowing us to drop the argument in the call if the default value
is appropriate. Such arguments are called *keyword arguments* or
*default arguments*. Here is an example:

!bc pypro
def s(t, v0=1, a=1):
    return v0*t + 0.5*a*t**2

value = s(3, 0.2, 4)         # specify new v0 and a
value = s(3)                 # rely on v0=1 and a=1
value = s(3, a=2)            # rely on v0=1
value = s(3, v0=2)           # rely on a=1
value = s(t=3, v0=2, a=2)    # specify everything
value = s(a=2, t=3, v0=2)    # any sequence allowed
!ec

!bnotice Notice
 * Arguments without the argument name are called *positional arguments*.
 * Positional arguments must always be listed before the keyword arguments
   in the function and in any call.
 * The sequence of the keyword arguments can be arbitrary.
 * If argument names are used for all arguments (as in the last line above)
   the sequence of the arguments is not important.
!enotice

idx{vectorization}
idx{vectorized functions}

!bnotice Vectorized functions
Applying the function `s(t, v0, a)` to an array `t` can be done
in two ways:

!bc pycod
# Scalar code: work with one element at a time
for i in range(len(t)):
    s_values[i] = s(t_values[i], v0, a)

# Vectorized code: apply s to the entire array
s_values = s(t_values, v0, a)
!ec
For the last line to work, the function `s` must contain statements
that work correctly when `t` is an array argument.

The advantage of vectorized code is that we avoid a loop in Python.
Instead, we carry out mathematical operations on entire arrays, e.g.,
`v0*t` and `a*t**2`. Technically, such (binary) operations are
executed as loops in very fast (compiled) C code.
!enotice

idx{multiple return values}

A function can return more than one value, say $s(t)$ and the
velocity $s'(t)=v_0 + at$:

!bc pypro
def movement(t, v0, a):
    s = v0*t + 0.5*a*t**2
    v = v0 + a*t
    return s, v

s_value, v_value = movement(t=0.2, v0=2, a=4)
!ec
When $n$ values are returned, we list $n$ variables on the left-hand
side in the call.

!bnotice Python functions return only one object
Even when we return several values, as in `return s, v`, actually only
one object is returned. The `s` and `v` values are packed together
in a *tuple* object (which is very similar to a list).

!bc pyshell
>>> def f(x):
...     return x+1, x+2, x+3
...
>>> r = f(3)     # Store all three return values in one object r
>>> print r
(4, 5, 6)
>>> type(r)      # What type of object is r?
<type 'tuple'>
>>> print r[1]

!ec
Tuples are constant lists, so you can index them as lists, but you cannot
change the contents (`append` or `del` is illegal).

===== A more general mathematical formula =====
label{basics:formula:piecewise}

The formula (ref{basics:seq}) arises from the basic differential
equations in kinematics:

!bt
\begin{align}
v = \frac{ds}{dt},\quad s(0)=s_0,
label{basics:vdef}\\
a = \frac{dv}{dt},\quad v(0)=v_0\thinspace .
label{basics:adef}
\end{align}
!et
Given any acceleration $a(t)$, we can solve for $s(t)$ through integration.
First, we integrate to find $v(t)$:

!bt
\[ \int_0^t a(t)dt = \int_0^t \frac{dv}{dt} dt,\]
!et
which gives

!bt
\[ v(t) = v_0 + \int_0^t a(t)dt\thinspace . \]
!et
Then we integrate again over $[0,t]$ to find $s(t)$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
s(t) = s_0 + v_0t + \int_0^t\left( \int_0^t a(t)dt \right) dt\thinspace .
label{basics:s:at}
\end{equation}
!et

Suppose we have some constant acceleration $a_0$ in $[0,t_1]$ and no
acceleration thereafter. We find

!bt
\begin{equation}
s(t) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
s_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}a_0 t^2,& t\leq t_1\\
s_0 + v_0t_1 + \frac{1}{2}a_0 t_1^2 + a_0t_1(t-t_1),& t> t_1
\end{array}\right.
label{basics:seq2}
\end{equation}
!et

To implement a function like (ref{basics:seq2}), we need to
branch into one type of code (formula) if $t\leq t_1$ and another
type of code (formula) if $t>t_1$. This is called *branching* and
the *if test* is the primary construction to use.

===== If tests =====
label{basics:if}

idx{branching}
idx{if test}
idx{boolean expression}

An if test has the structure

!bc pycod
if condition:
    <statements when condition is True>
else:
    <statements when condition is False>
!ec
Here, `condition` is a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` or
`False`. For the piecewisely defined function (ref{basics:seq2})
we would use an if test in the implementation:

!bc pycod
if t <= t1:
    s = v0*t + 0.5*a0*t**2
else:
    s = v0*t + 0.5*a0*t1**2 + a0*t1*(t-t1)
!ec

The `else` part can be omitted when not needed. Several branches are
also possible:

!bc pycod
if condition1:
    <statements when condition1 is True>
elif condition2:
    <statements when condition1 is False and condition2 is True>
elif condition3:
    <statements when condition1 and conditon 2 are False
     and condition3 is True>
else:
    <statements when condition1/2/3 all are False>
!ec

A Python function implementing the mathematical function (ref{basics:seq2})
reads

@@@CODE src-bumpy/plot3.py fromto: def s_func@n = 201

To plot this $s(t)$, we need to compute points on the curve.
Trying to call `s_func` with an array `t` as argument will not
work because of the if test. In general, functions with if tests
will not automatically work with arrays because a test
like `if t <= t1` evaluates to an if applied to a boolean
array (`t <= t1` becomes a boolean array, not just a boolean).

One solution is to compute the function values one by one in a loop
such that the `s` function is always called with a scalar value for `t`.
Appropriate code is

@@@CODE src-bumpy/plot3.py fromto: n = 201@plt\.plot

Relevant statements for plotting are now

@@@CODE src-bumpy/plot3.py fromto: plt\.plot@

idx{vectorizing if tests}

!bnotice Vectorization of functions with if tests
To vectorize the computation of the array of $s(t)$ values, i.e.,
avoid a loop where `s_func` is called for each `t[i]` element,
we must completely rewrite the if test. There are two methods:
the `numpy.where` function and array indexing.

=== Using the `where` function ===

A vectorized if-else test can be coded as

!bc pycod
s = np.where(condition, s1, s2)
!ec
Here, `condition` is an array of boolean values, and
`s[i] = s1[i]` if `condition[i]` is `True`, and otherwise `s[i] = s2[i]`.

Our example then becomes

!bc pycod
s = np.where(t <= t1,
             v0*t + 0.5*a0*t**2,
             v0*t + 0.5*a0*t1**2 + a0*t1*(t-t1))
!ec
Note that `t <= t1` with array `t` and scalar `t1` results in a boolean
array `b` where `b[i] = t[i] <= t1`.

=== Using array indexing ===

It is possible to index a subset of indices in an array `s` using
a boolean array `b`: `s[b]`. This construction picks out all the
elements `s[i]` where `b[i]` is `True`. On the right-hand side
we can then assign some array expression `expr` of the same length
as `s[b]`:

!bc pycod
s[b] = (expr)[b]
!ec
Our example can utilize this technique with `b` as `t <= t1` and `t > t1`:

!bc pycod
s = np.zeros_like(t)  # Make s as zeros, same size & type as t
s[t <= t1] = (v0*t + 0.5*a0*t**2)[t <= t1]
s[t > t1]  = (v0*t + 0.5*a0*t1**2 + a0*t1*(t-t1))[t > t1]
!ec
!enotice

===== Array view versus array copying =====

Arrays are usually large and most array libraries have carefully designed
functionality for avoiding unnecessary copying of large of amounts of data.
If you do a simple assignment,

!bc pycod
a = np.linspace(1, 5, 5)
b = a
!ec
`b` becomes a just *view* of `a`: the variables `b` and `a` point
to the same data. In other languages one may say that `b` is a
pointer or reference to the array. This means that changing `a` changes
`b` and vice versa:

!bc pycod
array([ 1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.])
>>> b[0] = 5                       # changes a[0] to 5
>>> a
array([ 5.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.])
>>> a[1] = 9                       # changes b[1] to 9
>>> b
array([ 5.,  9.,  3.,  4.,  5.])
!ec

Similarly, `b[1:-1]` gives a view to a subset of `a` and no copy of data.
If we want to change `b` without affecting `a`, a copy of the array
is required:

!bc pycod
>>> c = a.copy()       # copy all elements to new array c
>>> c[0] = 6           # a is not changed
>>> a
array([ 1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.])
>>> c
array([ 6.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.])
>>> b
array([ 5.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.])
!ec
Note that `b` remains unchanged by the change in `c` since the `b` and `c`
variables now refer to different data. Copying of the elements of a sub-array
is also done by the `copy()` method: `b = a[1:-1].copy()`.

!bwarning Understand the difference between view and copy!
Mathematical errors and/or inefficient code may easily arise from
confusion between array view and array copying. Make sure you
understand the implication of any variable assignment to arrays!

!bc pycod
a = np.array([-1, 4.5, 8, 9])
b = a[1:-2]            # view: changes in a are reflected in b
b = a[1:-2].copy()     # copy: changes in a are not reflected in b
!ec

===== Linear systems =====

idx{linear systems}
idx{sparse matrix}
idx{tridigonal matrix}

Solving linear systems of the form $Ax=b$ with a matrix $A$ and vectors
$x$ and $b$ is a frequently encountered task. A sample $2\times 2$ system
can be coded as

!bc pypro
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1., 2],
              [4,  2]])
b = np.array([1., -2])
x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
!ec

Many scientific computing problems involves large matrices with special
*sparse* structures. Significant memory and computing time can be
saved by utilizing *sparse matrix* data structures and associated
algorithms.
Python has sparse matrix package "scipy.sparse": "http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html" that can be used to construct
various types of sparse matrices. The particular
function `scipy.sparse.spdiags` can construct a sparse matrix from
a few vectors representing the diagonals in the matrix
(all the diagonals must have the same length as the dimension of their
sparse matrix, consequently some elements of the diagonals are not used:
the first $k$ elements are not used of the $k$ super-diagonal, and
the last  $k$ elements are not used of the $-k$ sub-diagonal).
Here is an example of constructing a *tridiagonal* matrix:

!bc pyshell
>>> import numpy as np
>>> N = 6
>>> diagonals = np.zeros((3, N))   # 3 diagonals
diagonals[0,:] = np.linspace(-1, -N, N)
diagonals[1,:] = -2
diagonals[2,:] = np.linspace(1, N, N)
>>> import scipy.sparse
>>> A = scipy.sparse.spdiags(diagonals, [-1,0,1], N, N, format='csc')
>>> A.toarray()    # look at corresponding dense matrix
[[-2.  2.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 [-1. -2.  3.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0. -2. -2.  4.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0. -3. -2.  5.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0. -4. -2.  6.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0. -5. -2.]]
!ec

Solving a linear system with a tridiagonal coefficient matrix requires
a special function with a special algorithm to take advantage of
the matrix' structure. The next example chooses a solution `x`,
computes the corresponding right-hand side $b=Ax$ using the
sparse matrix vector product associated with the sparse matrix $A$,
and then solves $Ax=b$:

!bc pyshell
>>> x = np.linspace(-1, 1, N)  # choose solution
>>> b = A.dot(x)               # sparse matrix vector product
>>> import scipy.sparse.linalg
>>> x = scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve(A, b)
>>> print x
[-1.  -0.6 -0.2  0.2  0.6  1. ]
!ec

Although we can easily check that `x` is correctly computed, we can
do another check by converting the linear system to its dense
counterpart:

!bc pyshell
>>> A_d = A.toarray()            # corresponding dense matrix
>>> b = np.dot(A_d, x)           # standard matrix vector product
>>> x = np.linalg.solve(A_d, b)  # standard Ax=b algorithm
>>> print x
[-1.  -0.6 -0.2  0.2  0.6  1. ]
!ec

======= Files =======
label{basics:files}

This section outlines basic file handling in Python, including file
utilities in the `numpy` package.

===== File reading =====

Suppose we create a file with typical input data to our little
demo program for evaluating the formula $s(t)=v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$:

!bc dat
v0 = 2
a = 0.2
dt = 0.1
interval = [0, 2]
!ec
We want to read the parameters in the file into Python variables and
create a table with columns of $t$ and $S(t)$ for $t\in [0,2]$ with
steps of $\Delta t=0.1$ (as specified by `dt` and `interval` in the file).

The code for reading the lines in the file, interpreting them, and
assigning values to variables is given next.

@@@CODE src-bumpy/for_file_read_input.py fromto: infile = @t_values =
The name of the file is here `.input.dat`, and it is opened with the
parameter `'r'` for reading. The for loop `for line in infile` will
read the lines from the file, one by one, and in the current line
is available in the string `line`. To split a line into words separated
by a character '=', we use `line.split('=')`, resulting in a list of
the words. For example,

!bc pyshell
>>> line = 'v0 = 5.3'
>>> variable, value = line.split('=')
>>> variable
'v0 '
>>> value
' 5.3'
!ec
Note that there are blanks in the strings. Leading and trailing blanks
can be removed by `variable.strip()`. We do this before comparing
the variable name with `v0`, `a`, etc.

It is important to note that `value` (the text to the right of `=` on
each line) is a string variable. We need to convert to a `float` object to
get a variable that we can compute with.
The assignment `interval = eval(value)` does some magic and deserve
an explanation: `eval(s)` interprets the text in the string `s` as
Python code. In the present example, `value` is `[0, 2]` and this
is interpreted as Python code, i.e., as a list, and `interval` becomes
a name for a list object with content `[0, 2]`.

A more modern Python way of opening files is

!bc pycod
with open('.input.dat', 'r') as infile:
    for line in infile:
        ...
!ec
Now it is not necessary to close the file as it will be automatically done
after the `with` block.

===== File writing =====

Suppose we generate $t$ and $s(t)$ values in two lists, `t_values` and
`s_values`, and want to write these as a nicely formatted table to file.
The following code does the work:

@@@CODE src-bumpy/for_file_read_input.py fromto: outfile =@# Alternative

Files intended for writing must be opened with a `'w'` parameter.
The key statement is `outfile.write(s)` for writing a string to
a file (recall that while `print` automatically adds a newline
at the end of the string to be printed, `outfile.write(s)` does not
append a newline so `s` must contain the newline).

The `numpy` package contains a convenient function `savetxt` for saving
tabular data. The data must be stored in a two-dimensional `numpy` array.
The `savetxt` function enables control of the format of the numbers
in each column (`fmt`) through the printf syntax, a header can be
added (`header`) and the header lines begin with a comment character
(`comment`). The code reads

@@@CODE src-bumpy/for_file_read_input.py fromto: import numpy as@# Read the file back

The tabular data in the file can be read back into a
`numpy` array by the `loadtxt` function:

@@@CODE src-bumpy/for_file_read_input.py fromto: data = np\.loadtxt@
Lines beginning with the comment character are skipped in the reading.
The resulting object `data` is a two-dimensional array: `data[i,j]` contains
row number `i` and column number `j` in the table, i.e., `data[i,0]`
holds the $t$ value and `data[i,1]` the $s(t)$ value in the `i`-th
row.


!split
======= Classes =======
label{basics:class}

All objects in Python are in fact implemented as classes, but you can
program with objects without knowing about classes. Nevertheless,
the class concept is a powerful tool and some basic knowledge will
make it easier to understand much useful Python information that is
floating around.

===== A very simple class =====

A class packs together a set of variables and a set of functions. All
functions can access all variables.[^class-terminology] The idea is
to encapsulate variables and functions in logical units such that a
larger program can be composed by combing such units (classes).

[^class-terminology]: In classes, the functions are called
*methods* and the variables are called *attributes*.

Here is a trivial class that has one variable `a` and one
function `dump` that writes the contents of `a`:

!bc pycod
class Trivial:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a

    def dump(self):
        print self.a
!ec

How can we use this class? First, we must make an *instance* (object)
of the class:

!bc pycod
t = Trivial(a=4)
!ec
The syntax `Trivial(a=4)` implies a call to the `__init__` method (function)
with `4` as the value of the argument `a`. Inside `__init__`,
we store the value of `a` as an attribute in the class: `self.a`.
If there were several methods in the class, all of them could then
access `self.a` (as if `a` were some global variable in the class).
The `__init__` function is called a *constructor* since it is used
to construct an instance (object) of the class.

Having an instance `t` of class `Trivial`, we can call the `dump` method
as follows:

!bc pycod
t.dump()
!ec
Even though both `__init__` and `dump` have `self` as first argument,
this argument *is not used in a call*.

!bnotice The `self` argument
It takes time and experience to understand the `self` argument in
class methods.

 o `self` must always be the first argument.
 o `self` is never used in calls.
 o `self` is used to access attributes and methods inside methods.

We refer to a "more comprehensive text on classes":
"http://hplgit.github.io/primer.html/doc/pub/class/index.html"
for better explanation of `self`.
!enotice

===== A class for representing a mathematical function =====

The Python implementation of the mathematical function

!bt
\[ s(t; v_0, a) = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2\]
!et
can benefit from being implemented as a class. The reason is that
$s$ is a function of one variable, $t$, so it should be called as
$s(t)$, but the function also contains two parameters, $v_0$ and $a$.
Using a class, we can pack $v_0$ and $a$ together with a function
computing $s(t)$ and that can be called with one argument.


=== The class code ===

!bc pycod
class Distance:
    def __init__(self, v0, a):
        self.v0 = v0
        self.a = a

    def __call__(self, t):
        v0, a = self.v0, self.a  # make local variables
        return v0*t + 0.5*a*t**2
!ec

=== Dissection ===

The class has two methods (functions). The name of a method can
be freely chosen by the programmer, say `dump` as we used above,
but here we have used three
special names, starting and
ending with double underscores, which allows us to use special
attractive syntax in the calls (such methods are actually known as
*special methods*).

The constructor `__init__` has one purpose: storing data in
class attributes, here `self.v0` and `self.a`. We can then access
these data in class methods.

The `__call__` method is used to evaluate $s(t)$. It has one
argument (`self` does not count since it is never used in calls).
This special methods allows us to view a class instance as if
were a function. Let us illustrate by some code:

!bc pycod
s = Distance(v0=2, a=0.5)  # create instance
v = s(t=0.2)               # runs s.__call__(t=0.2)
!ec
The last line has some magic: `s` is a class instance, not a function,
but still we can write `s(t=0.2)` or `s(0.2)` as if `s` were
a function. This is the purpose of the special method `__call__`:
to allow such syntax. Actually, `s(0.2)` means
`s.__call__(0.2)`. The nice result is that `s` looks like a
function, it takes one argument `t`, as the mathematical function $s(t)$,
but it also contains values of the two parameters $v_0$ and $a$.

In general, for a function $f(x,y,z; p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n)$, here with
three independent variables and $n$ parameters $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n$,
we can pack the function and the parameters together in a class:

!bc pycod
class F:
    def __init__(self, p1, p2, ...):
        self.p1 = p1
        self.p2 = p2
        ...

    def __call__(self, x, y, z):
        # return formula involving x, y, z and self.p1, self.p2 ...
!ec
The $f$ function is initialized by

!bc pycod
f = F(p1=..., p2=..., ...)
!ec
and later called as `f(x, y, z)`.

===== Exercise: Plot two functions =====
label{basics:exer:plot2}

As Exercise ref{basics:exer:plot2}, but add a black dashed
curve for the function
$h(y)=e^{-\frac{3}{2}y}\sin (4y)$. Include a legend for each
curve (with names `g` and `h`).

!bsol
Here is the program:

!bc pypro
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from numpy import exp, sin  # avoid np. prefix in g(y) and h(y)

def g(y):
    return exp(-y)*sin(4*y)

def h(y):
    return exp(-(3./2)*y)*sin(4*y)

y = np.linspace(0, 4, 501)
plt.figure()
plt.plot(y, g(y), 'r-', y, h(y), 'k--')
plt.xlabel('$y$'); plt.ylabel('$g(y)$')
plt.title('Damped sine wave')
plt.legend(['g', 'h'])

===== Exercise: Measure the efficiency of vectorization =====
label{basics:exer:timeit}

"IPython": "http://ipython.org/" an enhanced interactive shell
for doing computing with Python. IPython has some user-friendly functionality
for quick testing of the efficiency of different Python constructions.
Start IPython by writing `ipython` in a terminal window.
The interactive session below demonstrates how we can use the
timer feature `%timeit` to measure the CPU time required by
computing $\sin (x)$, where $x$ is an array of 1M elements, using
scalar computing with a loop (function `sin_func`) and vectorized
computing using the `sin` function from `numpy`.

!bc ipy
In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: n = 1000000

In [3]: x = np.linspace(0, 1, n+1)

In [4]: def sin_func(x):
   ...:     r = np.zeros_like(x)  # result
   ...:     for i in range(len(x)):
   ...:         r[i] = np.sin(x[i])
   ...:     return r
   ...:

In [5]: %timeit y = sin_func(x)
1 loops, best of 3: 2.68 s per loop

In [6]: %timeit y = np.sin(x)
10 loops, best of 3: 40.1 ms per loop
!ec
Here, `%timeit` ran our function once, but the vectorized function
10 times. The most relevant CPU times measured are listed, and we
realize that
the vectorized code is $2.68/(40.1/1000)\approx 67$ times faster
than the loop-based scalar code.

Use the recipe above to investigate the speed up of the
vectorized computation of the $s(t)$ function in
Section ref{basics:func}.
